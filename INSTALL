Installation information for the Test Dept. Framework
=====================================================
To install Test Dept., untar the distribution and change working
directory to that of "test-dept".  Then make sure you are running GNU
make.

To create the Makefile, issue:

> ./configure

To build the framework and all self-tests:

> make

Then to run the self-test suite issue:

> make check

All tests should pass.  You should see a line forming with only dots
".", and no "F" characters.  When the tests have passed, issue the
following command to install the framework:

> sudo make install

This should be enough.  It installs a bunch of scripts and makefile
snippets into bin and include directories, respectively.
