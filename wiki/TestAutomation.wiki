#summary Automating tests renders an effective way of working

=Automation=
In general, test automation is good. However, when test work is automated
it tends to cause a less flexible environment. As a programmer you are
more tied to the framework used. The reality looks somewhat like
the graph below:

This is not necessarily a good thing. When programmers are forces
in line simply by not being able to stray out of them, projects
tend to focus. At least that is the [TestDept Test Dept.] philosophy.

==Different ways of automating tests with Test Dept.==
[TestDept Test Dept.] is usable in a couple of ways:

  * Without fuzz; i e the usage described on the [TestDept frontpage]
  * With some manual intervention, but still automated
  * Manual use of all, or some, of [TestDept Test Dept.]'s convenience functionality

These different ways of usage are described below.
