#summary An introduction to the Test Dept. unit testing framework

= Introduction =

The goals of the Test Dept. framework for unit-testing are to:

* Be usable for pure C-projects
* Support stubs for C (or at least replaceable functions)
* Be compatible with different test runners
* Encourage independent test cases

In practice, these goals are (somewhat) reached by:

* A macro-based assertion suite for C
* Makefile snippets for replacing symbols in SUT for stubbing
* Standardizing the observable test suite behavior
* Using runnable binaries as suites - one binary per suite

These concepts are all described later in this README. For everything
to work properly there are some prerequisites:

* It needs GNU make(1) for building suites.
* It uses objcopy(1) and nm(1) for stubbing.
* It depends on the __LINE__ and __FILE__ macros of gcc(1) for assertions.
* It uses awk(1) and sed(1) for some textfile processing.

Both nm(1) and objcopy(1) are often parts of a "binutils" package.
